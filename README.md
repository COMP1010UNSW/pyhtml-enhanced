# PyHTML Enhanced

A library for building HTML documents with a simple and easily learnable
syntax, inspired by, and similar to
[the original PyHTML library](https://github.com/cenkalti/pyhtml), but with
improved documentation and type safety.

## Benefits over PyHTML

* Inline documentation and type safety for all tags. Documentation for tags
  is pulled from MDN Web Docs.

* A modern and readable codebase.

* No dependencies.

## Usage

```py
import pyhtml as h

my_website = h.html(
    h.head(
        h.title("Hello, world!"),
        h.script(src="http://example.com/script.js"),
    ),
    h.body(
        h.h1("Hello, world!"),
        h.p("This is my amazing website rendered with PyHTML Enhanced!"),
    ),
)

# Converting it to a string is all you need to do to render it!
print(str(my_website))
```

This will produce the following HTML code:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="http://example.com/script.js"></script>
    <title>
      Hello, world!
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>
      Hello, world!
    </h1>
    <p>
      This is my amazing website rendered with PyHTML Enhanced!
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## TODOs

There are a couple of things I haven't done yet

* [ ] Make tags by themselves render, so `str(br)` renders to `<br/>`
* [ ] Add default properties to tags
* [ ] Make inline documentation include documentation of suggested properties
* [ ] Update links within documentation to make them point to the right
      locations.

## How it works

Since there are so many HTML tags, it would be extremely tedious to document
them all manually. In the `meta` directory, you will find code that solves this
problem with the following steps:

1. Download the Markdown source for
   [MDN's documentation of all HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

2. Parse the markdown to gather all tag names and descriptions, discarding
   garbage data and obsolete tags.

3. Use data from a YAML configuration file ([`meta/tags.yml`](meta/tags.yml))
   to gather information on suggested properties and base classes to use for
   each tag.

4. Generate Python code to represent all of these tags.
