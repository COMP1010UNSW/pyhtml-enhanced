# PyHTML Enhanced

A library for building HTML with a simple and easily learnable syntax, inspired
by, and similar to
[the original PyHTML library](https://github.com/cenkalti/pyhtml), but with
improved documentation and type safety.

### [Cenkalti/PyHTML](https://github.com/cenkalti/pyhtml)

Cenk Alti's work was used as a source of inspiration and reference. Although
all the code in `pyhtml-enhanced` was written by me, I want to note the
significant influence it brought.

### [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

Much of the documentation was gathered from the MDN Web Docs, in particular
the page documenting all
[HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).
