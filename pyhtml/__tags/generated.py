This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use `<b>` for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS {{cssxref("font-weight")}} property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the strong element.
