# Credits

## [Cenkalti/PyHTML](https://github.com/cenkalti/pyhtml)

Cenk AltÄ±'s work was used as a source of inspiration and reference. Although
all the code in `pyhtml-enhanced` was written by me, I want to thank them for
the significant help their hard work provided while creating this project,
going as far as to give design advice on request.

## [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

Almost all of the documentation was gathered from the MDN Web Docs. It's super
neat that all their documentation is open (licensed as
[CC-BY-SA-2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) if you're
interested).

## COMP1010 students and staff

COMP1010's students and staff members have uncovered and helped to resolve many
bugs, and have suggested many improvements. I'd like to thank them for all of
their help!
